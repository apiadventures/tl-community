# Welcome #

Welcome to a new tech leaderhip community.  There are a bunch of communitys, forums and newsletters online for technical leaders (Rands, CTO Craft, etc) but I wondered if I might create a community through my own network of technical leaders. Often I turn to people I know and whom I've worked directly with for advice, and it's helped me numerous times.  So, I wondered if there was a way to widen this network slowly over time and build a way that folks could keep in touch (e.g. Alumni from various companies past and present) and bring people together around various topics

# The Rules #
You know I don't like rules, so fuck that.  Principles and guidelines are better. But one thing I'd like to enforce is confidentiality of discussions and information shared in order that *all* feel able to discuss sometimes tricky issues openly.  So, the only rule to apply is the Chatham House Rule

## The rule states: ##
When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity, nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.  So, the boundary stops at you, the member of this community. You may discuss/share what you have learnt with colleagues/anyone but you may not reveal the people or companies involved. Not even to your colleagues.
