# Tech Leadership Community 

Welcome to a new tech leadership community.  There are a bunch of communities, forums and newsletters online for technical leaders (Rands, CTO Craft, etc) but I wondered if I might create a community through my own network of technical leaders. Often I turn to people I know and whom I've worked directly with for advice, and it's helped me numerous times.  So, I wondered if there was a way to widen this network slowly over time and build a way that folks could keep in touch (e.g. Alumni from various companies past and present) and exchange information, ideas or even ask for help and advice from peers in similar roles acroos the world.

Being a technical leader is hard and requires managing multiple, complex situations and challenges concurrently.  These could be related to peopl, process, technology, architecture, strategy, funding, product, design, operations, etc.
