# Tech Leadership Community 

Welcome to a new tech leadership community.  There are a bunch of communities, forums and newsletters online for technical leaders (Rands, CTO Craft, etc) but I wondered if I might create a community through my own network of technical leaders. Often I turn to people I know and whom I've worked directly with for advice, and it's helped me numerous times.  So, I wondered if there was a way to widen this network slowly over time and build a way that folks could keep in touch (e.g. Alumni from various companies past and present) and exchange information, ideas or even ask for help and advice from peers in similar roles acroos the world. In essence, create a hive-mind of trust experts.  So welcome!

Being a technical leader is hard and requires managing multiple, complex situations and challenges concurrently.  These could be related to peopl, process, technology, architecture, strategy, funding, product, design, operations, etc.

# The Rules #

Please read the [guidelines](https://github.com/apiadventures/tl-community/blob/main/community-intro.md) before you go any further.

# Invitations #

Can I invite others to the slack community? *Yes, but* first do they 'cut the mustard?' ?
- have you worked with them directly in the past (or present) ?
- do you feel they can add to the community (via ideas, experiences, knowledge, skills, etc) ?
- can you vouch that they will not try sell us anything (no sales) ?
- would you love to work with or for them again ?
- would you happily meet them for an after work beer, fika, lunch, etc without hesitation ?
